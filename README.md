Meerkat Logging
===============

The [Meerkat.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Meerkat.Logging/) library is a simple logging framework for use internally withing the Meerkat libaries

The rationale is so we don't take a dependency on external logging framework such as Common.Logging, log4net etc and possible introduce dependency conflicts to a client project
